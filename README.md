## üíª My Role: Front-End Developer

As the **Front-End Developer** for this project, I was responsible for the entire user-facing interface. My tasks included:
  - **Implementation**: I built all front-end components using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**, based on the provided UI/UX designs into a fully functional web application
  - **Responsiveness**: A key part of my role was ensuring the application is fully responsive, providing a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project was a valuable exercise in applying core web development principles to build a complete, functional front end.
